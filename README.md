Uprent Plus 🚀
An experimental extension for Uprent exploring innovative features for the Dutch rental market

💡 The Concept
Uprent Plus is a side project testing advanced rental search features that current platforms don't offer. Built to explore what's possible and understand what renters actually need in the competitive Dutch market.

Why This Exists

Three simple goals:

Test new ideas — Real-time alerts, AI-powered letters, smart matching

Learn the market — Understand user pain points and competitor gaps

Deliver value — Build features people actually want to use
